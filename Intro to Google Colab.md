# Using notebooks with answer checks

How to use notebooks with "checks" and interactive content.
The notebooks in this precourse will make use of "assert" statements to check code you have written for various exercises. If the cell contains a 'DO NOT EDIT THIS CODE', then don't edit the code that follows.

In addition, there will be a few notebooks which contain interactive cells: you will be prompted to enter input to answer questions, using your code and output from previous cells.

The following notebook will provide a basic introduction for how the assert statements work and how to go through the notebook and check your answers: [Interactive Notebook Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/134FEFIHeM-zyzY-hg-KMvdeEE4HNtJv4#scrollTo=yfHKguLkKvK6)

There is no assignment submission associated with this tutorial notebook. Just work through the tutorial linked above and when you're ready, you can begin watching the lectures videos and completing assignments!
