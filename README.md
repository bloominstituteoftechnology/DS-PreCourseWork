# Welcome to BloomTech's Data Science Intro Course!
> PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT BEFORE STARTING

This course is a prerequisite to BloomTech's Data Science Course. While there are important fundamental data science skills that you will learn from this course, we also want to see your grit and tenacity in completing challenging material. We have found that a student's ability to persevere is a much better indicator of success than previous experience.

### How to succeed in this course
- Watch all assignment videos and follow along in your own Google Colab document. Not only will this provide you with valuable notes to refer back to after you have watched the videos, (useful during assignments) but the active nature of typing along will help you retain the information better.
- Complete all assignment exercises. The assignments are similar to the lecture content but differ in ways that will help stretch your brain and force you to think for yourself rather than copying someone else's code.
- Set aside a block of time every day to work on the material. Practice! It will pay off in the end.
